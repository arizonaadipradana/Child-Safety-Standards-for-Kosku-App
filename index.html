        <h1>Kosku App - Child Safety Standards</h1>
        
        <p>At Kosku, we are committed to creating a safe environment for all users, with a particular focus on protecting children from exploitation and abuse. This document outlines our safety standards and procedures.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Commitment to Child Safety</h2>
        <p>Kosku is a property management and rental app primarily designed for adults seeking or managing boarding houses ("kos") in Indonesia. Despite not being primarily targeted at minors, we recognize our responsibility to implement measures that protect all users, especially children, from potential harm.</p>
        
        <h2>Preventative Measures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age Verification:</strong> Users must verify they are 18 years or older during registration.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Monitoring:</strong> We employ both automated systems and human review to detect inappropriate content, including images and messages that may indicate child exploitation.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Messaging:</strong> Our in-app messaging system includes safety features designed to detect and prevent potentially harmful interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>User Verification:</strong> Property owners go through a verification process to establish their identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Report Functionality:</strong> Easy-to-use reporting tools are available throughout the app for users to flag concerning content or behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Response Procedures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Any content or behavior potentially involving child exploitation is immediately removed and accounts suspended pending investigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Law Enforcement Cooperation:</strong> We promptly report all instances of suspected child exploitation to relevant authorities in accordance with applicable laws.</li>
            <li><strong>User Support:</strong> Our team is trained to handle sensitive reports with appropriate urgency and care.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>User Guidelines</h2>

            <li>Sharing personal contact information of minors</li>
        </ul>
